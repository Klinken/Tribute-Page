                Michelangelo (originally Michaelangelo), nickname Mike or Mikey, is a fictional character
                and one of the four main characters of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all related media.
            </p>

                He is usually depicted wearing an orange eye mask. His signature weapons are dual nunchaku,
                though he has also been portrayed using other weapons, such as a grappling hook, manriki-gusari, tonfa,
                and a three-section staff (in some action figures).
            </p>

            <p>
                More fun-loving than his brothers and the youngest of the group, Michelangelo was given a much bigger role in the 1987 cartoon series,
                directed at a younger audience, than in the more serious original comic books, which were aimed at an older audience.
                He often coins most of their catchphrases, such as "Cowabunga!". Like all of the brothers, he is named after a Renaissance artist;
                in this case, he is named after Michelangelo Buonarroti. The spelling of the character's name varies from source to source,
                and he has been alternately shown as both Michelangelo and Michaelangelo.
            </p>

            Michelangelo began the series with his trademark nunchaku as his weapons, but controversy surrounding the weapons in the United Kingdom led to scenes of their use being edited out of the local broadcast of the series. To compensate for this, the American showrunners dropped the nunchaku from the series entirely in the third season, replacing them with a grappling hook called the "Turtle Line" that served as Mikey's signature weapon for the rest of the show's run.

                Michelangelo also received his distinctive voice, which has been imitated in other portrayals of him, in the 1990 series. Employing a "surfer slang" vocabulary, he customarily spoke with a unique hybrid of a Californian surfer accent (not unlike the speech of the Spicoli character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and what may have been a stereotypical "stoner" accent, though no reference is ever made to drugs in the series and it is likely that the voicing simply emphasized his laid-back and somewhat innocent attitude. In fact, Michelangelo appeared in a 1990 animated special, Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue, alongside other famous cartoon characters, intended to inform children about the dangers of substance abuse. Additionally, all four of the Turtles were official "spokes-turtles" of the "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign, despite accusations that at least one of them exhibited characteristics of a stoner. During one of these anti-drug PSAs, Michelangelo suggests to a kid being tempted with marijuana that he should "get a pizza" to go with it, before the idea is shot down by Donatello. Michelangelo's trademark phrase in this series is the famous "Cowabunga".
